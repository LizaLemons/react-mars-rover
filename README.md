# NASA Mars Rover Pictures with React

---


I built this app using [NASA's Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos) and Axios to make AJAX calls.

Simply clone, `npm install`, and `npm start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
